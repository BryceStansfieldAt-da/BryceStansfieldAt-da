- 👋 Hi, I’m @BryceStansfieldAt-da (otherwise known as @BryceStansfield outside of work).
- 👀 I’m interested in how you found this profile if you're not a DA worker, did some of my work get released publicly?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DAML at rapid pace!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work I suppose.
